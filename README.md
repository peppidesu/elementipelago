# Elementipelago

Elementipelago is an alchemy-game developed for [Archipelago](archipelago.gg). Think doodle-god, but now for your favorite multiworld randomizer.

## How it works

The items you receive are **Elements** used for crafting. These elements are named after the location where they were found.

You combine elements from the drawer to create products. Products can be one of the following:

- **Intermediates**: Don't give checks, but can be used for further crafting
- **Compounds**: Give checks and aren't used for crafting (unless `compounds_are_ingredients` is enabled)

There is also the "TODO" filler item, which currently does nothing. In the future this will be replaced by functional filler items, traps and upgrades.

## How to play

1. Download and install the `elementipelago.apworld` from the latest release tag;
2. Generate your YAML using the Options Creator in the Archipelago Launcher and generate your multiworld;
3. Host the AP server locally, on archipelago.gg or any remote that allows secure websocket connections;
4. Go to https://elementipelago.peppidesu.dev/ and connect to your slot.
